	<b>How I first came to the City of Brass</b><br />
		I was born in the mountains East of the City of Brass.  My family grew mushrooms.  Dwarfs like mushrooms.  We sold mushrooms to the dwarfs.  My father thought he could make more money selling mushrooms in the City of Brass.  There are dwarfs there and others as well.  He took my mother and me to the City of Brass when I was 12.  He had a plan with his brother $brothername.  $Brothername would buy mushrooms from the farmers in the mountains.  He would bring them to the City of Brass and my father would buy them from him.  Then my father would sell them to other people.<br />
		The $CoBmob wanted my father to pay them protection money.  He did not want to.<br />
	<b>How I met the Long Knives</b><br />

	<b>Why I first left the City of Brass</b><br />
		When I was 15 my mother died.  She was sick for some time and I spent time by her bedside ministering to her.  We did not have much money for a doctor.  I had to take care of my mother.<br />
		My father was sad that my mother died.  He was so sad that he did not do much work.  He just drank fermented mushroom juice all day long.  He did not sell very many mushrooms.  Soon he started running out of money.  He had to go to the $Cobmob for money.  They gave him a loan.  They would not give him very much.  He could not afford to take care of me.  He sent me back to the mountains to live with his family.<br />
	<b>What happened in the mountains and how I first killed</b><br />
		I had been away from home for some time.  While I was gone, an eladrin named Higgins had set himself up as lord of my homelands.  When I left my town had been populated entirely by tieflings.  We had been there since the days of Bael Turath.  We were proud of our heritage.  Nobody from my town wanted to be a vassal to Higgins.<br />
		The people could not fight him.  Whenever somebody challenged him he would fight them.  Usually they would end up cowering in fear of him.  Some people were braver.  But his armor was strong and they could not hurt them.  If they hit him they would soon die.  Their flesh would rot from within.<br />
		I was sad that my friends and family were oppressed.  I belived in the noble heritage of Bael Turath.  I got some of the men together and I told them my plan.  They were not sure they trusted me because I was so young.  I reminded them that the longer they waited the worse things would be.  Higgins was very dangerous.  I was as persuasive as I could be.  Finally they agreed.<br />
		I challenged Higgins to combat.  But when he came to meet me, we all attacked together.  I led the attack, but everyone there had a hand in it.  We killed him.  I took his armor and sword for my own.  We went to his castle and took his treasures.<br />
	<b>How I got my scars</b><br />
		Higgins had been very rich.  With my share of his treasure I could pay my father's debts.  I returned to the City of Brass with my money.  I could not find my father.  Someone else was living in our old apartment.  There was a leather store where our mushroom shop used to be.
