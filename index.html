		<b class="break">How I first came to the City of Brass</b><br />
		<p class="inner">
			I was born in the mountains East of the City of Brass.
			My family grew mushrooms.
			Dwarfs like mushrooms.
			We sold mushrooms to the dwarfs.
			My father thought he could make more money selling mushrooms in the City of Brass.
			There are dwarfs there.
			Others live there as well.
			He took my mother and me to the City of Brass when I was 12.
			He had a plan with his brother $brothername.
			$Brothername would buy mushrooms from the farmers in the mountains.
			He would bring them to the City of Brass.
			My father would buy them from him.
			Then my father would sell them to other people.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			The $CoBmob wanted my father to pay them protection money.
			He did not want to.
		</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>How I met the Long Knives</b><br />
		<p class="inner">
			While I lived in Elysium it was very dangerous.
			It was good to have a gang to watch your back.
			It was hard for Tieflings to join a gang.
			I was persuasive enough to join one.
			I joined the Long Knives.
			I made friends in the gang.
			One of them was named Malakar D'Nossos.<!--Mark-->
			Another was $traitorname.
		</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Why I first left the City of Brass</b>
		<p class="inner">
			When I was 15 my mother died.
			She was sick for some time.
			I spent time by her bedside ministering to her.
			We did not have much money for a doctor.
			I had to take care of my mother.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			My father was sad that my mother died.
			He was so sad that he did not do much work.
			He just drank fermented mushroom juice all day long.
			He did not sell very many mushrooms.
			Soon he started running out of money.
			He had to go to the $Cobmob for money.
			They gave him a loan.
			They would not give him very much.
			He could not afford to take care of me.
			He sent me back to the mountains to live with his family.
		</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>What happened in the mountains and how I first killed</b><br />
		<p class="inner">
			I had been away from home for some time.
			While I was gone, an eladrin named Higgins had set himself up as lord of my homelands.
			When I left my town had been populated entirely by tieflings.
			We had been there since the days of Bael Turath.
			We were proud of our heritage.
			Nobody from my town wanted to be a vassal to Higgins.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			The people could not fight him.
			Whenever somebody challenged him he would fight them.
			Usually they would end up cowering in fear of him.
			Some people were braver.
			But his armor was strong.
			They could not hurt them.
			If they hit him they would soon die.
			Their flesh would rot from within.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			I was sad that my friends and family were oppressed.
			I belived in the noble heritage of Bael Turath.
			I got some of the men together.
			I told them my plan.
			They were not sure they trusted me because I was so young.
			I reminded them that the longer they waited the worse things would be.
			Higgins was very dangerous.
			I was as persuasive as I could be.
			Finally they agreed.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			I challenged Higgins to combat.
			But when he came to meet me, we all attacked together.
			I led the attack, but everyone there had a hand in it.
			We killed him.
			I took his armor and sword for my own.
			We went to his castle.
			We took his treasures.
		</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>How I got my scars</b><br />
		<p class="inner">
			Higgins had been very rich.
			With my share of his treasure I could pay my father's debts.
			I returned to the City of Brass with my money.
			I could not find my father.
			Someone else was living in our old apartment.
			There was a leather store where our mushroom shop used to be.
			I asked people if they knew where he was.
			I found out that he had just disappeared one day.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			I knew that my father had not been able to pay the $cobmob.
			They had killed him.
			That was the sort of thing they do.
			It makes other people afraid not to pay their debts.
			Before this I had seen it happen many times.
			I decided I would try to destroy the $cobmob.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			I used Higgins's money to make some contacts and learn about the $cobmob.
			I found out that some well-respected members of society were involved.
			I went and told the guards about it.
			I thought they would be excited to see my proof.
			Instead they threw me in jail.
			They were involved with the $cobmob as well.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			The guards did not want to process me as a normal criminal.
			They gave me to a $cobmob enforcer to torture and kill.
			He put my face in a forge fire.
			He thought that the burns would kill me.
			He left me for dead but I survived.
			I decided that the system was broken.
			I would not be able to solve anything by working inside it.
			I decided to get together the people who had been hurt by it.
			We would kill everyone who had exploited them.
			We would make a better world for ourselves.
		</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>That all went wrong</b>
		<p class="inner">
			I got back together with the Long Knives.
			It was important for the $cobmob to think that I was dead.
			Nobody recognized me because of my burn scars.
			I only told a few people who I really was.
			One of them was $traitorname.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			I convinced the Long Knives to help me with my vision.
			We worked to figure out who was in charge of the $cobmob.
			After years of searching we had a long list of people.
			We started setting up a plan.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			Some of the heads of the $cobmob were nobles and members of the high court.
			We would have to be careful.
			If we killed one of them the others would find out.
			They would get extra security and be harder to kill.
			We would have to kill all of them at once.
			Soon there would be a ball at the palace.
			Everyone attending was on our list.
			It was a perfect opportunity.
			We would kill them all.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			$traitorname did not show up on time for the attack.
			Nobody knew where he was or why he wasn't there.
			We did not have time to wait for him.
			We went ahead with the plan and snuck in.
			But $traitorname had betrayed us.
			There were many guards there.
			Most of the Long Knives were killed.
			A few were captured.
			I escaped.
		</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Now what</b>
		<p class="inner">
			If I go to the City of Brass, the guards will kill me.
			I have set out to build an army.
			I will gather together all those with the power and will to withstand corruption.
			We will return to the City of Brass and we will burn it to the ground.
		</p>
		<p class="inner">
			As for $traitorname, I hope I see him again. We need to reminisce about old times.
